# linux-control-center
A simple fun little project for myself to practice bash scripting. I'm going to make a linux control center that should display some useful things like disk usage, ports and memory usage.

## Scope (v1)
Read-only

Display disk usage.
Display ports.
Display uptime.
Display memory usage.

## Planned interface
Simple text UI, nothing fancy.

## Non-goals
No remote access
No config system
No cross-distro guarantees

## Status
Very early
Learning project
